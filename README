Xprint is now deprecated.

For a WYSIWYG-style printing API giving equivalence between what appears in an 
X windows and what gets printed on paper or to pdf or postscript, you may want 
to consider using libcairo, the Cairo graphics library 
(http://cairographics.org/)

Font support for Xprint was removed from libXfont 1.4. To build Xprt under
libXfont 1.4 (or later) you will need to use built-in fonts 
    ./configure --enable-builtin-fonts
(By default built-in fonts are not used, equivalent to --disable-builtin-fonts).

However built-in fonts may cause a segfault in client programs, which has not 
been debugged since Xprint is deprecated. For an operational Xprt you may want 
to built against libXfont 1.3.
